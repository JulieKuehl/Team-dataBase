# Team-dataBase
A repo for Team dataBase of the Interface-Flywheel WordPress course. A playground for learning. And maybe some actual work.

##First "Project"
I put up a camp song where you substitute different types of beans in the song. It can get kind of hilarious, in a 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall kind of way.

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account.

2. Clone the repo to your desktop

2. Find and replace "Lima" with your favorite kind of bean and save the file.

3. Push the changes back to GitHub

4. Come back to this page and submit a "Pull Request"


OK, that's way too complicated. We'll talk about this in person.
